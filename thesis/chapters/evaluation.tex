This chapter presents an evaluation of \bpfbox{} and \bpfcontain{} in terms of their
performance and security. \Cref{s:eval-performance} presents the methodology and results
of a performance evaluation involving micro- and macro-benchmarking of \bpfbox{} and
\bpfcontain{}. Results are compared with AppArmor~\cite{cowan2000_apparmor}, a popular
\gls{lsm} framework for \gls{mac} security policy. Finally, \Cref{s:eval-security}
presents a security analysis of \bpfbox{} and \bpfcontain{} under the threat model
outlined in \Cref{s:cp-threat-model} of \Cref{c:confinement-problem}.

  Might be useful for later when we compare with AppArmor:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Zhang \etal~\cite{zhang2021_lsm_file_overhead} evaluated the performance
    overhead of LSMs on file system operations; they mentioned (really damning) performance
    statistics for SELinux that can be compared with BPFContain and AppArmor
  \end{itemize}

Here, we evaluate the overhead of \bpfbox{} and \bpfcontain{} by examining their performance
over a series of macro- and micro-benchmarks. For
