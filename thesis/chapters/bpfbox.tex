This chapter presents the design and implementation of \bpfbox{}, an initial research
prototype of an \gls{ebpf}-based confinement framework. \bpfbox{} is the first full-fledge
confinement framework to leverage \gls{krsi} \gls{lsm} programs to enforce policy. Using
\gls{ebpf}, it combines various behavioural aspects of the sandboxed application from both
userspace and kernelspace to enforce a simple, yet fine-grained policy defined in
a domain-specific policy language. This chapter was a part of a previously published paper
at CCSW'2020, co-authored with Anil Somayaji and David Barrera.




\section{\bpfbox{} Overview}

\todo{This section will present an architectural overview of \bpfbox{}, summarize key
features and what it can do.}



\section{\bpfbox{} Implementation}

\todo{This section will present the implementation details of \bpfbox{}, taken from our paper.}




\section{\bpfbox{} Policy Language}

\todo{This section will present and document the policy language of \bpfbox{}, taken from our paper.}





\section{Limitations and the Transition Toward \bpfcontain{}}

\todo{This section will discuss limitations of \bpfbox{}, how it was a rough first-cut at
a solution to the confinement problem, and talk about the aspects of \bpfbox{} that
\bpfcontain{} improves upon.}
