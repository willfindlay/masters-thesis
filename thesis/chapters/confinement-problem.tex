Researchers have been studying confinement for decades~\cite{lampson1973_confinement}, and
have been designing and applying confinement primitives since the early days of
time-sharing computers and multi-tenant systems~\cite{shu2016_security_isolation_study}.
Process-level virtualization has become similarly important, but for subtly different
reasons\,---\,namely, for the purpose of restricting and modifying a process' visibility
into the rest of the system.  Decades of research into virtualization and confinement
techniques has culminated in a wealth of knowledge and prior artifacts, some of which have
seen widespread deployment and remain relevant to date. The rest of this section presents
technical background on such process-level virtualization confinement mechanisms and
surveys the academic literature related to this area.
