\section{Methodology}

\todo{This section will present the methodology used to select existing policies and
compare them with \bpfbox{} and \bpfcontain{} policies}


\section{The Default Docker Policy}

\todo{This section will describe how \bpfbox{} and \bpfcontain{} can be used to implement
the default Docker confinement policy and compare it with AppArmor/SELinux/Seccomp-bpf policy}


\section{Confining a Webserver and Database}

\todo{This section will describe how \bpbox{} and \bpfcontain{} can be used to confine an
Apache Webserver and Postgres Database configuration and then compare the resulting policy
with Snap, AppArmor, and SELinux}
