In this chapter, we examine specific case studies, applying \bpfbox{} and \bpfcontain{}
policies to solve realistic problems. In particular, we examine the default Docker policy
and a more complex example confining a web server and database. We also provide an example
of how \bpfcontain{} can be used to apply basic confinement to an untrusted container. To
offer a basis for comparison, we contrast presented policies with some available
equivalents and discuss how the semantics of the policy language and enforcement engine
can impact the resulting policy file.

\section{The Default Docker Policy}

Docker~\cite{docker_security} applies a coarse-grained default confinement policy to all
containers using a combination of Linux confinement primitives. On supported
systems\footnote{Recall that not all Linux distributions support AppArmor or Seccomp-bpf
to begin with. In such cases, Docker simply discards its default confinement policy
altogether.}, this includes a default AppArmor policy template~\cite{docker_apparmor,
docker_default_apparmor}, a default Seccomp-bpf profile, and a set of POSIX capabilities
which are dropped at runtime~\cite{docker_security}.

Docker's policy defaults are highly coarse-grained, with an emphasis on practical security
while ensuring that the vast majority of container configurations will \enquote{just
work,} out of the box. This affords a practical opportunity to examine how \bpfbox{} and
\bpfcontain{} policies compare with the default Docker policy. \Cref{tab:docker-default}
summarizes the key aspects of Docker's confinement policy, highlighting default access
levels enforced by various Linux confinement primitives. \Cref{lst:docker-default} depicts
Docker's default AppArmor template, taken directly from the Docker sources on
GitHub~\cite{docker_default_apparmor}.

\subsubsection{\bpfbox{}}

We begin by examining a mostly equivalent policy in \bpfbox{}, given in
\Cref{lst:bpfbox-docker-default}.  Re-implementing Docker's default confinement policy in
\bpfbox{} is surprisingly challenging. \bpfbox{} is not designed to implement
coarse-grained confinement policy, and so specifying things like global access to all
files is impossible. We compromise by granting recursive access to all files within
a given filesystem, repeating the process for each filesystem as required. This is
\textit{not} the intended use case for \bpfbox{} file rules, but it is required to match
the over-permissive filesystem access provisioned by Docker. Aside from
filesystem-specific policy, most of Docker's default policy can be implemented relatively
easily and cleanly in \bpfbox{}'s policy language.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bpfbox, gobble=4,

  label={lst:bpfbox-docker-default}]
    #![profile "/path/to/init/program"]

    #[allow] {
      /* Allow essentially global access to a filesystem */
      fs("/path/to/filesystem/**", read|write|setattr|getattr|rm|link|ioctl)
      /* Repeat for others... */

      /* Allow access to /proc/sys/kernel/shm* */
      fs("/proc/sys/kernel/shm*", read|write|setattr|getattr)

      /* Sensible default access for procfs per-pid entries */
      proc(self, read|write)
      proc(child, read|write)
    }

    #[allow]
    #[taint]
    {
      /* Access to network families */
      net(inet, any)
      net(inet6, any)
      net(unix, any)

      /* Ptrace child processes */
      ptrace(child, read|write|attach)

      /* Send sigchld up to parent processes, any signal to children */
      signal(parent, sigchld)
      signal(child, any)
    }

    #[transition]
    #[untaint]
    {
      /* Allow execve calls to allowed executables,
       * tainting and transitioning profiles when doing so */
      fs("/path/to/allowed/executable", read|exec)
      /* Repeat for others... */
    }
\end{lstlisting}

Like Docker's AppArmor policy, our \bpfbox{} policy enables access to per-pid entries in
procfs and uses \bpfbox{}'s default-deny enforcement to restrict all others. Similar logic
applies to the \texttt{/proc/sys/kernel/shm**} entries under procfs. We also grant full
networking stack access, ptrace access for child processes, and full signal access for
child processes running under the container. Since these operations have the potential to
introduce vulnerabilities from outside sources, we mark them as tainting the corresponding
process. Leveraging taintedness, the \bpfbox{} policy eliminates the need to specify
access to shared library dependencies and other artifacts of the C runtime.

For more complex container deployments that include more than a single binary, the
\bpfbox{} policy may need to specify access to alternative executables under the
container.  We do so using an individual file rule for each executable, optionally
specifying that the process should untaint itself and/or transition to a new profile.
Notably, the version of \bpfbox{} presented in this thesis does \textit{not} include
capability-level policy, and so it is not included here\footnote{\bpfcontain{} later
rectified this gap in \bpfbox{}'s policy language.}. However, the default Docker
confinement policy does not implement capability-level filtering anyway, instead relying
on dropped capabilities at runtime.

Although the \bpfbox{} policy depicted in \Cref{lst:bpfbox-docker-default} does not fully
map to the precise Docker default policy, it gets very close in most respects, aside from
filesystem policy. Under \bpfbox{}, filesystem policy is necessarily finer-grained, as it
does not support the ability to specify coarse-grained access to all files on the system.
Despite these challenges, the end-result is a functional (and, in some aspects, more
secure) alternative to the default Docker policy.

\subsubsection{\bpfcontain{}}

Having examined how \bpfbox{} can be used to implement an approximate version of Docker's
default confinement policy, we now turn our attention to \bpfcontain{}.
\Cref{lst:bpfcontain-docker-default} shows the full \bpfcontain{} policy. Note that many
aspects of Docker's default policy are covered by \bpfcontain{}'s default
container-boundary enforcement. Using this to its advantage, the \bpfcontain{} policy is
significantly simpler than both the AppArmor and \bpfbox{} versions while maintaining the
same level of expressiveness.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=yaml, gobble=4,
  caption={[Implementing the default Docker policy in \bpfcontain{}]
    Implementing the default Docker policy in \bpfcontain{}. A few coarse-grained
    allow-rules can be used to capture permissive Docker defaults that are not covered
    under \bpfcontain{}'s default policy. Other aspects of the Docker defaults are already
    covered under \bpfcontain{} defaults, such as the inability to mount filesystems,
    perform a number of privileged system calls, and interact with non-pid entries in
    procfs and sysfs. Due to \bpfcontain{}'s default policy for file access and \gls{ipc},
    it is neither necessary to specify file access rules for files within the container's
    overlay filesystem not \gls{ipc} rules for processes within the container.

\end{lstlisting}

Compared with \bpfbox{}, the \bpfcontain{} version of Docker's default policy is
significantly simpler and fits more cleanly with Docker's AppArmor policy. This
improvement is a direct result of a number of critical differences between \bpfbox{} and
\bpfcontain{}. Whereas \bpfbox{} was designed for fine-grained, process-level confinement,
\bpfcontain{} was directly designed with containers in mind. Since \bpfcontain{} policies
are designed to be container-specific, they are far more appropriate for a use case
centered around the confinement of containers. In particular, \bpfcontain{} incorporates
container semantics into its default policy enforcement, greatly simplifying the resulting
policy.  Further, changes to \bpfcontain{}'s policy language, including the introduction
of a coarser-grained filesystem rule and capability rules enables the resulting policy to
more closely match the original Docker AppArmor policy.

To match Docker's default allow on all filesystem access, the \bpfcontain{} policy
includes a rule to enable any file operation on files within the root filesystem.  As with
\bpfbox{}, the point here is to match Docker's default policy, without considering the
security implications of granting full access to the entire root filesystem. We include
another rule to enable similar access on the temporary filesystem. Despite the coarse
granularity of these filesystem rules, \bpfcontain{} maintains a critical advantage over
\bpfbox{} and the original Docker policy. Due to its container-specific policy defaults,
we can achieve Docker's fine-grained protection over procfs and sysfs for free. Thus,
\bpfcontain{} entirely obviates the need to specify such rules in the policy.

As with the procfs and sysfs policy, \bpfcontain{} also includes sensible defaults for
\gls{ipc} and ptrace access. In particular, processes running within the same container
are free to perform \gls{ipc} with one another and ptrace one another, so long as the
basic Unix access rights are satisfied (e.g.~the process possesses CAP\_PTRACE or is the
direct ancestor of the tracee). In the case of signals and ptrace, these defaults directly
match the Docker policy (c.f.~\Cref{tab:docker-default}).  In other cases, these defaults
are more secure than the Docker policy, while permits all other forms of \gls{ipc}
regardless of container membership.

To prevent a container from escaping confinement or interfering with the host,
\bpfcontain{} prohibits the container from mounting filesystems, loading kernel modules,
using \gls{ebpf}, changing the system time, rebooting the system, or performing a number
of other privileged operations. These defaults also match or exceed Docker's default
policy, and thus may also be omitted from the \bpfcontain{} policy.

While many aspects of \bpfcontain{}'s default enforcement closely match the default Docker
policy, \bpfcontain{}'s defaults remain strictly less permissive. For instance, the
default Docker policy mandates that \texttt{/proc/sys/kernel/shm*} be accessible to
containers, but \bpfcontain{} denies access to all procfs entries that do not belong to
a container process. We define an exception to \bpfcontain{}'s default procfs policy by
adding an explicit allow rule on this pathname. Similarly, \bpfcontain{}'s default policy
forbids network access by default, and so we must explicitly grant the container
permission to use the networking stack. Unlike Docker, \bpfcontain{} prohibits the use of
any POSIX capability that is not directly specified in the policy file. Thus, we include
an additional allow rule that mirrors the set of capabilities dropped by Docker at
runtime.

The resulting \bpfcontain{} policy implements a strict superset of Docker's default
confinement policy, despite being significantly simpler, and more centralized.  Since
\bpfcontain{} directly models the relationship between containerized processes and their
resources, we can achieve significant portions of Docker's default policy for free. In
many cases, this default enforcement is actually finer-grained than the Docker defaults.
In order to achieve the same coarse granularity as the Docker policy, we adjust the
\bpfcontain{} policy by incorporating a few additional allow rules, granting access to
specific filesystems, the networking stack, and POSIX capabilities.

\section{Confining an Untrusted Container}

We now examine perhaps the most obvious and practical use case for \bpfcontain{}:
confining and untrusted container. For instance, consider a new container image, freshly
downloaded from Docker Hub, to be used during application development or testing.  We
assume that the system administrator does not trust this container images, and wishes to
confine the resulting containers, preventing them from damaging the rest of the system,
leaking information, or performing other unwanted actions. For this purpose, we leverage
an extremely simple \bpfcontain{} policy (essentially the \enquote{Hello World} example)
and demonstrate how it can be customized to match the container's specific needs.
\Cref{lst:bpfcontain-untrusted} depicts this policy.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=yaml, gobble=4,
  caption={[Confining an untrusted container with \bpfcontain{}]
    Confining an untrusted container with \bpfcontain{}. \bpfcontain{}'s default
    enforcement policy of defining a boundary around the container enables this policy to
    be quite simple. A default-tainted policy enables container-level confinement without
    specifying \textit{any} rules whatsoever. This policy can then be adjusted as
    required, specifying file rules to provision access to volume mounts, network rules to
    enable networking, and capability rules to enable access to specific POSIX
    capabilities.
  },
  label={lst:bpfcontain-untrusted}, float]
    name: untrusted-container
    defaultTaint: true

    allow:
      # Specify full path and access for volume mounts from the host
      file: {pathname: /path/to/volume/mount, access: rw}
      # Repeat for other volume mounts as required...

      # Uncomment if the container requires networking
      # We could also define finer-grained access by replacing the "any"
      # keyword with specific socket operations
      # net: any

      # Uncomment if the container requires any capabilities
      # capability: [dacoverride, dacreadsearch, netbindservice] # etc.
\end{lstlisting}

Note that \bpfbox{} is not the correct tool for this job. Without \bpfcontain{}'s semantic
defaults, a \bpfbox{} policy would need to manually specify every single access required
for the container to function. Thus, it is impossible to design a generically-applicable
solution using \bpfbox{}. The key advantage of \bpfcontain{} here is that it can use
container semantics to infer a default protection boundary for the container. This greatly
simplifies the resulting policy while ensuring that the container is unable to access
resources outside of its protection boundary, unless otherwise specified. The resulting
\bpfcontain{} policy is just a few lines long.

We define a default-tainted \bpfcontain{} policy called \enquote{untrusted-container}.
Just this policy alone should be enough to confine a simple container. \bpfcontain{}'s
default policy would prohibit network access, the use of any POSIX capabilities, access to
any files outside of the container's overlay filesystem, and any operations that can
impact the system as a whole. This default policy prevents entire classes of attacks,
prohibiting the container from leaking outside information, changing global system
parameters, loading code into the kernel, or forming unauthorized network connections. The
reader is encouraged to revisit \Cref{fig:bpfcontain-enforcement} on page
\pageref{fig:bpfcontain-enforcement} of \Cref{c:bpfcontain} for a depiction of how
\bpfcontain{}'s default enforcement works.

While the \bpfcontain{} default policy should be sufficient for simple use cases, more
advanced container images may require some slight modification, introducing a few allow
rules to define exceptions in \bpfcontain{}'s protection boundary. For instance, suppose
the container image requires a docker volume to be mounted at runtime. To support this use
case, we define a file rule, specifying the system path to the volume mount and the
corresponding access pattern, such as \texttt{rw} for read and write access. All other
accesses to the host filesystem remain denied. If the container requires access to the
networking stack, we similarly define a net rule.  Capability rules can be used to allow
the container to use a selected subset of POSIX capabilities, assuming it already
possesses these capabilities at runtime. For example, we may wish to grant the container
the \texttt{DAC\_OVERRIDE} and \texttt{DAC\_READ\_SEARCH} capabilities to allow it to
interact with the Docker volume we specified earlier, or the \texttt{NET\_BIND\_SERVICE}
capability to allow it to bind to privileged ports.
