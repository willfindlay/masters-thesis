Key Changes
 - define confinement early
 - explain geometric mean
 - clarify 2% STDEV/11+ runs
 - explain performance oddities
 - compare overhead with academic security efforts (quote stats)
 - virtualization: aggregation & segregation
 - remove virtualization less secure than container confinement
 - clarify forward & backward compatibility
 - (discuss how to break it)
 - use latexspand and latexdiff to make pdf with changes marked
 

Paula
-----
 - add definition of confinement early in thesis
 - different attack models?  discuss limits
    - clarify the specific attacks addressed, and not addressed
 - (asked about security of containers vs VMs)
 - policy through mechanism vs policy through exception
    - clarification?
 - challenges when implementing?
 - implementation language alternatives?
 - why geometric mean?  Table 6.10, explain meaning


Lianying
--------
 - also, def of confinement should be earlier
   - boundary & confinement explanation
   - how different from CFI
   - iago attack?
 - your definition of confinement is same as reference model,
   too generic
   - address bpfbox vs bpfcontain
 - resource bounds, really out of scope or just a limitation?  (cgroups)?
 - clarify what you mean by process level (confinement, virtualization, isolation)
    - discuss where attacks come from?
 - virtualization can be aggregation, not just segregation, should explain
   - p. 50, fig 25
   - clarify type 1 vs type 2 hypervisors
 - explain hardware primitives, not understanding OS semantics?
 - minor editorial issues (left in todo, typos)
 - no benchmarks for application, clarify you didn't measure application
   (event logging?)
 - negative values imply problems with experimental apparatus?  Error bars?
    - how much variance?
    - how many trials, was it ever more than 11?
 - clarify, best to talk to container engine to find boundary, using ad-hoc methods now
 - forward and backwards compatibility? clarify what you mean
 - explain difference in attack surface, VM vs system calls
 - compare with overhead of academic security efforts?  just quote their numbers, no need to generate again
 
Anil
----
 - mention precedence for negative overhead
 - explain complexity of bpfcontain when discussing performance vs bpfbox

Open round
-----
 - Paula: how would you do a more rigorous formal evaluation?  strategy?
 - Paula: summary of novelty?  vision of the future?
 - Paula: how would you attack bpfbox/bpfcontain?
    - discuss input validation
    
 - Lianying: order of priorities surprising for containers
     - but wasn't always the case, eg solaris zones
