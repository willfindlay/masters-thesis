How do you define confinement?
P91
behavioural restrictions -> concerning outside resources -> protection boundary
P44 FreeBSD Jails and Solaris Zones, Chroot
(iv) the host attacking a container.??
P51: "Resource starvation attacks are also considered out of scope." cgroups?
P42: Taint-tracking's relationship with confinement. What about Information Flow Tracking
Iago attacks
define process-level security
P48: definition of virtualization: aggregation vs seggregation
P50: Figure 2.5
"without sacricing forward or backward compatibility with alternative approaches"
POSIX capabilities: isn't orthogonal? breakdown of root?
P40: you use caps to refer to MAC approaches
CHERI: hardware, memory safety, lacking OS semantics
P18: grsecruity
P83: Anil?
P24: existence off malware
P28: addition so supporting
P30: a object manager
P53: (i) a containerized attacking the
P57: decisions could then used to make
P173: take steps protect itself
P78: "there is no fundamental reason why containers cannot be as|if not more|secure than virtual machines"
Attack surface?
"we run each test at least eleven times, until a standard deviation of at most 2% of the mean is achieved"
Why not fixed? SD also a metric?
How containter context/boundaries/semantics are idenfified? ad-hoc or heuristic, container engine specific? Figure 5.2 (Docker integration) ContainerID
P133: "In particular, default access to resources is determined based on whether that resource exists within the context of a container."
"Rather than combining xxx"
OCI Specication and Docker Integration
IPC: provided that they belong to the same container
Default Policy Default-Deny Container Boundary

Micro-benchmarking: type: app's perspective vs BPFBox's perspective
Another baseline for quick check: academic
negative overhead: check measurement error?
events throughput? P109: "polls for new data at regular intervals"
Phoronix Test Suite: other choices?






Improvement to eBPF itself?
policy-level diversity: more explanation?

P84: Container goals: decreasing prioritization, confinement as the last?
In RQ1: gaps between policies and entities. So proposing a mechanism? "policy enforcement mechanism"


pathname-based: check at runtime vs load time. Otherwise matching inode still TOCTOU?
Usability, e.g., links changed

policy enforcement vs. authorization
Clarify: root-level, privileged

porting/adoption effort: recompile


P104: attempts that do not directly come from BPFBox itself. How to

Network Rules: protocols (wrong footnote?)





P6: A vulnerability in any individual mechanism or a misconguration
in any individual policy opens the container or the host system itself up to attack.

not merely process -> process group

modern kernels dynamically allocate their major and minor number

Minor:
"discretionary access controls" refers to
start talking about eBPF before definition
