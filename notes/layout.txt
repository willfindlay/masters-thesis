Other Notes
-----------

- Should be included:
    - Capsicum (Background?)
        - Cherry capabilities
        - 128-bit memory pointers where first 64 bits encode capabilities/access rights
        - Pretty fancy, has a hardware requirement
        - Our stuff doesn't need specific hardware

Introduction

Background (Put Related Work Here Too)
    - Don't put too much spin
    - Talk up other people's work
        - We will tear this down in The Confinement Problem chapter
    - Confinement first
    - VMs and containers next
    - eBPF last

The Confinement Problem
    - Have it be its own chapter
    - Start with an overview of the confinement problem historically, why it's important
    - This is my framing/analysis of the problem
    - Talk about how crappy confinement is right now
        - Existing solutions are inadequate, increasingly complex, mixed and matched
        - The things we are building on top of are so complex that people don't even try to use them
        - The most-googled thing for these tools are how to turn them off
    - Policy languages are super complex, give examples of the existing policies
      (refer to these later when doing case studies)
    - We really need new capabilities from the kernel to do confinement right
        - Something unified
    - Establish what the requirements are for BPFBox and BPFContain

BPFBox Chapter
    - this should definitely be included
    - limitations
        - using python, dependency overhead
        - natural next step is containers
        - naive approach, first cut at the problem
    - conclude the chapter with what we have done better in BPFContain/how BPFContain is different

BPFContain Chapter

Case Studies
    - Here's the problem, here's how I'd solve it with available tools
    - Here's how I'd solve it with BPFBox, here's how I'd solve it with BPFContain
