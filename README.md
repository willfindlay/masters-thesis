# William Findlay's MCS Thesis

[![Build Thesis](https://github.com/willfindlay/masters-thesis/actions/workflows/compile.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/willfindlay/masters-thesis/actions/workflows/compile.yml)

This repository contains the files required to build a copy of my Master's Thesis. This
thesis and the software it documents will always be free and open source. That means free
as in money **and** free as in freedom. The goal is for this to be as useful as possible
to as many people as possible.
